# mira_server

A simple file host compatible with software such as ShareX. I also plan to make a sister application to this to use on macOS alongside [Flameshot](https://flameshot.org/), and will update this README once I have a repo created for it.

I can't come up with creative names.
Let's pretend MIRA is an acronym for `(M)inimal (I)mage (R)epository (A)pplication`.

## Usage

I really only intended this to be hosted on my server for personal use, and only open-sourced it due to my current lack of a public portfolio. You may use this project in any way you wish, including trying to self-host it, but beware that support nor (detailed) documentation will be provided.
